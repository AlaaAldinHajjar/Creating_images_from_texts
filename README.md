# Creating_images_from_texts
In this project I made a technique that can translate text to an image that can describe this text using GA and simple NLP from Stanford coreNlp library. 

To run this project you need to download stanford core nlp 2018 and open the cmd in it directory and type "java -mx4g -cp "*" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLPServer -port 9000 -timeout 1500000" then run the exe. :)

Here is the result of this sentence('A cake is on the table. Ahmad is holding a balloon. Ahmad is near the table. There is a tree.')
